# A-B-testing-Globox-
- An A/B test is an experimentation technique used by businesses to compare two versions of a webpage, advertisement, or product feature to determine which one performs better

- By randomly assigning customers or users to either the A or B version, the business can determine which version is more effective at achieving a particular goal.

### GloBox is primarily known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. However, their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue.The Growth team decides to run an A/B test that highlights key products in the food and drink category as a banner at the top of the website.
